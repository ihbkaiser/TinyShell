You can use TinyShell by compiling it with the following command:
```
g++ -std=c++23 -lgdi32 main.cpp -o main
```

You might see some warnings like: `backslash and newline separated by space`, but you can ignore them. Next, run the `main.exe` file. The console will display:
```
Enter command: 
```
... and let's start your adventure in our TinyShell world ^^
